#  This test simply records the 16-bit TCP window size of the received packet
# According to the following documentation, under "TCP initial window size (W, W1â€“W6)":
# https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html#osdetect-probes-seq

# "While this test is generally named W, the six probes sent for sequence generation purposes are a special case.
# Those are inserted into a special WIN test line and take the names W1 through W6. The window size is recorded
# for all the sequence number probes because they differ in TCP MSS option values,
# which causes some operating systems to advertise a different window size.
# Despite the different names, each test is processed exactly the same way."
